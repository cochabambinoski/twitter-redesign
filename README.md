### General

- Add descriptive README file to your repositories.
- Use meaningful names for your Pull Requests and add a short summary of its content.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit files that are not related to the project. Instead, add them to [.gitignore file].
- Do not commit inline comments. They will make your project look messy. If you need to review a previous version of your code, you can always use git history.

### Project specific

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

- It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
- You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

The project you are going to build for the Ruby on Rails capstone is based on a redesign of Twitter. You **should change the theme** of the app though - it can be an app to share opinions about books, wedding business, fishing equipment, mushrooms - anything that you can share opinions about with people who follow you. Feel free to add your own app name and logo!
